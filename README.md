AcNightlyTester 
===============

The ArchC Nightly Tester builds the ArchC, generates simulators for the Models 
and runs many tests to help us identify bugs. The ArchC server run this script 
generally once a day, using the HEAD on git master branch, for all source code.

You can modify the configuration files to test your ArchC code, in local 
machine. The configuration files (.conf) have explanations for the options. 
The output is a set of HTML files. 

Using the script:

```
./acnightly.py -h
